# Overview

Sample size: 10 patients (with multiple night recordings)
Current model accuracy: 83%

Goals:

1. Train model using PSG data from open-source database to classify sleep stages given EEG readings.
2. Build a physical EEG device to collect EEG readings from a user.

Future ideas:

- Look into training model using ECG and HRV instead of EEG?
  - ECG monitors are much more convenient to use
  - Other products have already implemented this with ~80-90% accuracy
